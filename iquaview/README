# IQUAview

IQUAview is the graphical user interface (GUI) that allows to operate the family of vehicles from Iqua Robotics in a simple and user-friendly manner. IQUAview provides a front-end to the COLA2 architecture in order to be able to communicate with the robot, configure a basic set of parameters, plan missions and monitor them using an intuitive graphical interface.

# Basic features

- Customization of the interface display with raster maps, vector charts or contextual information of the operational site in a large number of supported data formats.
- Easy access to vehicle and sensors configuration, pre-dive checks and routine procedures (teleoperation mode, calibration, status monitoring, etc).
- Graphical mission programming providing flexibility in the design through individual waypoint customization or the addition of predefined mission patterns.
- Command and monitoring of the vehicle through WiFi connection (using surface buoy or vehicle WiFi antenna).

Contact Iqua Robotics regarding plugin options (e.g, command and monitoring through acoustics, quick bathymetry processing, etc).

# User manual 

Download [IQUAview's user manual](https://bitbucket.org/iquarobotics/iquaview/wiki/IQUAview_user_manual.pdf) to learn in more detail the different features of IQUAview and how to use the interface to operate the vehicles of Iqua Robotics. 
You can test IQUAview together with a simulated instance of the software architecture of IQUA's vehicles. For that, check first the [COLA2 wiki](https://bitbucket.org/iquarobotics/cola2_core/wiki/Home).
